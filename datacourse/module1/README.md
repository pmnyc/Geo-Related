# Module 1: Data Manipulation and Cleaning in Python

## Summary
The first step of data science is mastering the computational foundations on which data science is built.  We cover the fundamental topics of programming relevant for data science - including pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, regular expressions, sql, json, xml, checkpointing, and web scraping - that form the core libraries around handling structured and unstructured data in Python.  Students gain practical experience manipulating messy, real-world data using these libraries.  They also walk away with a firm understanding of tools like pip, git, ipython, jupyter notebooks, pdb, and unit testing that leverage existing open source packages to accelerate data exploration, development, debugging, and collaboration.
